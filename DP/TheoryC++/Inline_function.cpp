Answer: b
Explanation: Inline are functions that are expanded when it is called. 
he whole code of the inline function gets inserted/substituted at the point of call. 
In this, they help in reducing the function call overheads. Also they save overhead 
of a return call from a function. Inline functions are generally kept small.
