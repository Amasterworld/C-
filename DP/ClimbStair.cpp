You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.

total number of ways to nth step = total ways to ((n-1)th + (n-2)th)
because one time, the people only can climb 1 or 2 steps
then  total ways to ((n-1)th = total ways to ((n-2) + (n-3)th) and so on
until the recursion ends, when n = 0 or 1, with the values = 1
